For this game the inspriation, as you'll see, came from the recent pop culture phenomenon of water bottle 
flipping videos virally posted on social media. I figured the idea was simple enough for a small game, so
I went for it. 

The goal of the game, currently, is to complete all 5 rounds. To do this, the player must flip
the water bottle on the table with it landing on its top or bottom. If it lands successfully on the top or
bottom, then another bottle unit is added to the player's given supply of bottles for that round (shown at the
top right of the screen). The player must successfully flip the displayed number of required flips (shown at 
the top of the screen as "0 / 3" for a required 3 successful flips). If the player's flip is not successful, 
then they lose a bottle unit. If there are no more bottles, then the player loses the round and has the option 
to try again in the same round. If the player's bottle supply count goes below the remaining required successful
flips left to win the round, then the player loses the round. For instance, if the player has 2 / 5 flips successful,
requiring at least 3 more successful flips to win, and reachs a bottle supply count of 2, then the player loses
the round.

The build currently runs on Windows.
